# About me!

My name is Noah Monson. I am a ECE major from Chelan Washington.

I like to ski, hike and rock climb. I also like watching baseball/football while drinking beers... 

I'm excited to do some more hands on work like we will be doing in this class. Git is confusing the hell outta me right now so I'm gonna bring this to a quick end.
